Q5. (a)
A hamiltonian path is a path which connects two vertices in a graph G, 
such that the path includes each vertex in G exactly once.

A euler path is a path which connects two vertices in a graph G, 
such that the path incldes each edge in G exactly once. 
An Euler path is a ptha that uses every edge in a grpah with no repeats. Being a path,
it does not have to return to the starting vertex.


Q5. (b)
Yes this graph has both hamiltonian and euler paths.
Hamiltonian paths: {0, 2, 1, 3, 0}, {0 , 1, 2, 3, 0}, etc.
