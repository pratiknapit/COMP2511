Question 4

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.

Ordered Linked List 

Push - O(n) (insert) 
Pop - O(1) (remove)
Print - O(n) (print & search)

Ordered Array 

Push - O(n) (insert) 
Pop - O(n) (remove)
Print - O(n) (print & search)

AVL Tree 

Push - O(log n) (insertion)
Pop - O(log n) (removal and rebalancing)
Print - O(n) (print/search) 

Hashtable 

A hastable cannot keep the order of a queue, therefore do not consider.

Heap 
Push - O(log n)
Pop - O(log n)
Print - O(n) (print) 

Therefore, the best data structure to use is the Heap or AVL tree. A heap is more often used.
