Question 1

What is the time complexity of the algorithm? Justify your answer.

Since we are breaking down the problem int two subproblems of size n/2, to solve this problem it 
will take O(log n). To convert a problem and compone takes O(n), therefore, that total time complexity of 
this algorithm is O(n * log n).
