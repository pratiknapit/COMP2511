Question 3

Note: if you need to promote a value, you must promote the smaller 
value from the available alternatives (if any). Justify your answer.

(a) 
(a1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 8? 
     Justify your answer.
     The insertion of 8 would not change the root node as the node that contains 3 including 8. Therefore,
     we will not need to promote any values.
     Therefore the values of the root node would still be 12 35 60.
     



(a2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 8? 
     Justify your answer.
     The values that would be stored in the node that contains 8 is 1 7 8. This is because we will
     simply insert 8 as the node is not full, we do not need to promote anything.



(b) 
(b1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 50? 
     Justify your answer.
     If we insert 50 then as the node with 36 44 57 is all full. Then we need to promote 44 to the upper node.
     Therefore As the upper node is already full, we would then need to promote 35. Therefore our root node 
     would contain only 35.



(b2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 50? 
     Justify your answer.

     The node that now contains 50 will now have 50 57, as we have promoted 44.
